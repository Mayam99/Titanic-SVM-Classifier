# Titanic Survival Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify and predict passenger survival. The Titanic dataset, available on Kaggle, includes various demographic, socioeconomic, and situational information about the passengers who were aboard the RMS Titanic. This project aims to demonstrate a full data science pipeline using SVM, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model tuning, with a focus on achieving optimal classification performance.

Project Overview

The objective of this project is to leverage SVM, a powerful classification algorithm known for its ability to create well-defined decision boundaries, to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. By employing hyperparameter tuning, we aim to optimize model performance and interpret key metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project also includes detailed steps and insights on:

* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions and analyzing patterns to uncover relationships between features and survival.
* Model Training: Implementing a baseline SVM model and refining it with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.
* Model Evaluation: Assessing the modelâ€™s performance using various metrics and validating it through cross-validation.
